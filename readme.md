# AI Prompt Assistant with Together API

This script is a simple CLI-based tool that leverages the together.ai API to interact with a LLM (`Llama-3.3-70B`). It streamlines the process of querying AI, especially useful for tasks like summarizing YouTube video transcripts — no need to bounce between services anymore.

## 🧠 Why This Exists

Most tools (like Gemini) choke when it comes to summarizing long YouTube videos. The usual workaround involved:
1. Generating a transcript.
2. Feeding it manually to a different AI model.
3. Asking for summaries.
This script kills that pain. One step, one model, fast output.
